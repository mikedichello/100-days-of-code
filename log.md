<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Completed section 8 of [CSS- The Complete Guide 2021](https://www.udemy.com/course/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/)

**Thoughts**: I have recently been jumping from course to course, and I really want to focus on completing all of the courses I have enrolled in. I think this would also kickstart my 100 days of code challenge. Also starting a project with Chaz
